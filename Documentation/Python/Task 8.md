# Task 8: Student Enrollment
In this task, a new student, John Doe, is enrolling in the SIS. The system needs to record John's information, including his personal details, and enroll him in a few courses. Database connectivity is  required to store this information.

**John Doe's details:**
- First Name: John
- Last Name: Doe
- Date of Birth: 1995-08-15
- Email: john.doe@example.com
- Phone Number: 123-456-7890

**John is enrolling in the following courses:**
- Course 1: Introduction to Programming
- ~~Course 2: Mathematics 101~~ (Since our System is not capable of handling multiple enrollments for same student to different courses, this task is not done yet.)
  
**The system should perform the following tasks:**
- Create a new student record in the database.
- Enroll John in the specified courses by creating enrollment records in the database.
